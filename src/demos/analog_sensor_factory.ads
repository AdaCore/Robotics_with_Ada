--  This package provides a factory function to create sensors in the class of
--  all analog sensors. The specific kind of sensor created is controlled by a
--  parameter.

--  Note that the factory function is meant to be called only once, in this
--  configuration, because it applies the same exact hardware devices to every
--  sensor created.
