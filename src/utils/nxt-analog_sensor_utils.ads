--  This package provides some utility routines for working with NXT analog
--  sensors.

with NXT.Analog;    use NXT.Analog;
with Ada.Real_Time; use Ada.Real_Time;

package NXT.Analog_Sensor_Utils is

   procedure Get_Average_Reading
     (Sensor     : in out NXT_Analog_Sensor'Class;
      Interval   : Time_Span;
      Result     : out Integer;
      Successful : out Boolean);
   --  Returns the average of the raw, inversely varying sensed input values
   --  acquired via Get_Raw_Reading (Sensor) during the sampling Interval.
   --  If any call to Get_Raw_Reading fails to acquire a value from the ADC,
   --  Result is 0 and Successful is False.
